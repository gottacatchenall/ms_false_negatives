        "Abstract": "Ecosystems are composed of networks of interacting species. These interactions allow communities of species to persist through time through both neutral and adaptive processes. Still a robust understanding of (and ability to predict and forecast) interactions among species remains elusive. This knowledge-gap is largely driven by a shortfall of data---although species occurrence data has rapidly increased in the last decade, species interaction data has not kept pace, largely due to the intrinsic difficulty and effort required to sample interactions. These sampling challenges bias data and hinder inferences about the structure and dynamics of interactions networks. Here, we demonstrate the realized false-negative rate (the percentage of species that actually interact but for which we do not yet have a record) can be quite high, even in thoroughly sampled systems, due to the intrinsic variation in abundances across species in a community. We illustrate how a null model of occurrence detection can be used to estimate the false-negative rate in a given dataset. We also show how to directly incorporate uncertainty due to observation error into model-based predictions of interaction probabilities between species. One hypothesis is that interactions between “rare” species are themselves rare because these species are less likely to encounter one-another than species of higher relative abundance. However, we demonstrate that across several datasets of spatial or temporally replicated networks, there are positive associations that suggest these interactions actually exist but just are not observed. Finally, we assess how false negatives influence various models of network prediction, and recommend directly accounting for observation error in predictive models. We conclude by discussing how the understanding of false-negatives can inform how we design monitoring schemes for species interactions."
