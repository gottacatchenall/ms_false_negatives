            <p>Community ecology is fundamentaly about understanding
            species interactions. Understanding how species interact
            underlies many question in evolutionary biology, community
            ecology, and is an increasing imperative to mitigate the
            anthropogoenic change on Earth’s biodiversity <span

            biodiversity data has become increasingly
            available—remote-sensing has enabled collection of data on
            spatial scales and resolutions previously unimaginable, and
            improved in-situ sensing <span class="citation"

            ecologists. Still, widespread data about species
            <em>interactions</em> remains elusive <span class="citation"
            data-cites="TIM_DATASET_PAPER">(<strong>TIM_DATASET_PAPER?</strong>)</span>.
            Often, observing an interaction between two species requires
            human sampling, typically because remote sampling methods
            can only detect co-occurrence, and this itself is not
            necessarily indicative of interaction <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Blanchet2020CooNot">(Blanchet <em>et al.</em>
            2020)</span>. This constraint induces biases on species
            interaction data subject to the spatial and temporal scales
            that humans can feasibly sample.</p>
            <p><em>Sampling effort</em> and its impact on the resulting
            data collected from ecosystems has encouraged a long history
            of discourse. The recorded number of species in a sample
            depends on the total number of observations <span
            class="citation"
            data-cites="Willott2001SpeAcc Walther1995SamEff">(Walther
            <em>et al.</em> 1995; Willott 2001)</span>, as do estimates
            of population abundance <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Griffiths1998SamEff">(Griffiths 1998)</span>.
            This has motivated more quantitatively robust approaches to
            account for error in sampling data in many contexts: to
            determine if a given species is extinct <span

            data-cites="Carlson2020WhaWou">(Carlson <em>et al.</em>
            2020)</span>. In the context of interactions, the initial
            concern was the compounding effects of limited sampling
            effort combined with the amalgamation of data (across both
            study sites and across taxonomic scales) could lead any
            empirical set of observations to inadequately reflect the
            reality of how species interact <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Paine1988RoaMap">(Paine 1988)</span>. <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Martinez1999EffSam">Martinez
            <em>et al.</em> (1999)</span> showed that in a
            plant-endophyte trophic network, network connectance is
            robust to sampling effort, but this done in the context of a
            system for which observation of 62,000 total interactions
            derived from 164,000 plant-stems was feasible. In some
            systems (e.g. megafauna food-webs) this many observations is
            either impractical or infeasible due to the absolute
            abundance of the species in question.</p>
            <p>Because we cannot feasibly observe all (or even many) of
            the interactions that occur in nature, our samples end up
            capturing only a small fraction of those interactions. This
            means we can be reasonably confident two species actually
            interact if we have a record of it, but not at all confident
            that two species <em>do not</em> interact if we have no
            record of those species observed together. In other words,
            it is difficult to distinguish true-negatives (two species
            <em>never</em> interact) from <em>false-negatives</em> (two
            species interact in some capacity, but we have not observed
            it). This is then amplified as the interaction data we have
            is geographically toward the usual suspects <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Poisot2021GloKno">(Poisot
            <em>et al.</em> 2021a)</span>, This noise in data has
            practical consequences for answering questions about species
            interactions <span class="citation"
            data-cites="deAguiar2019RevBia">(de Aguiar <em>et al.</em>
            2019)</span>—these false-negatives could go on to effect the
            inferences we make about network properties and relations
            among species, and our predictions about how species will
            interact in the future.</p>
            <p>This is compounded by semantic confusion about the
            definition of “interaction”. Here distinguish between: a
            species <em>occurring</em>, a species being <em>observed
            occurring</em>, two species being observed
            <em>co-occurring</em>, and two species being observed
            <em>interacting</em> (fig. <strong>¿fig:taxonomy?</strong>).
            In this manuscript, we refer to species either as
            “interacting”—two species co-occur (and, at least sometimes,
            interact)—or “not-interacting” (two species that, regardless
            of whether they co-occur, neither exhibits any meaningful
            effect on the biomass of the other). In
            fig. <strong>¿fig:taxonomy?</strong> we see that, under our
            definition, observing two species co-occurring is a
            prerequisite for observing an interaction between two
            species.</p>
            <p>But species are not observed with equal probability but
            instead in proportion to their relative biomass—you are much
            more likely to observe a species of high relative abundance
            than one of very low relative abundance <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Poisot2015SpeWhy">(Poisot
            <em>et al.</em> 2015)</span>. This assumes that there are no
            associations in species co-occurrence due to an interaction
            (perhaps because this interaction is “important” for both
            species) <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Cazelles2016TheSpe">(Cazelles <em>et al.</em>
            2016)</span>, but here we show increasing strength of
            associations leads to increasing probability of
            false-negatives in interaction data. Further observed
            co-occurrence is often equated with meaningful interaction
            strength, but this is not necessarily the case <span

            Bears and salmon <em>interact</em>—a bear and the microbes
            in the soil of a dens interact, but less so.</p>
            <p>Here, we show that the probability of observing a actual
            “non-interaction” between species depends on sampling
            effort, and suggest that surveys of species interactions can
            benefit from simulation modeling of detection probability
            <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Jordano2016SamNet">(Jordano 2016b)</span>. We
            demonstrate that the realized false-negative rate of
            interactions is directly related the relative abundance of a
            particular species, relationship between total sampling
            effort (the total count of all individuals of all species
            seen) and false-negative rate. questions we pose and attempt
            to answer are: 1) How many times do you have to observe a
            non-interaction between two species to be confident in
            saying that is a true negative? 2) How “wrong” are the
            measurements of network structure as a function of
            false-negative probability? and lastly 3) How do
            false-negatives impact our ability to make reliable
            predictions about interactions? We show that positive
            associations in co-occurrence data can increase realized
            probability of false negatives, and demonstrate these
            positive associations are present in two
            spatially-replicated systems. We conclude by suggesting that
            simulation of sampling effort and species occurrence can and
            should be used to help design surveys of species diversity
            <span class="citation" data-cites="Moore2016OptEco">(Moore
            &amp; McCarthy 2016)</span>, and by advocating use of null
            models like those presented here as a tool for guiding
            design of surveys of species interactions, and for modeling
            detection error in predictive ecological models.</p>

            <p>To answer the titular question of this section, we
            present a naive model of interaction detection: we assume
            that every interacting pair of species is incorrectly
            observed as a not-interacting with an independent and fixed
            probability, which we denote <span
            class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>f</em><em>n</em></sub></span>
            and subsequently refer to as the False-Negative Rate (FNR).
            If we observe the same species not-interacting <span
            class="math inline"><em>N</em></span> times, then the
            probability of a true-negative (denoted <span
            class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>t</em><em>n</em></sub></span>)
            is given by <span
            class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>t</em><em>n</em></sub> = 1 − (<em>p</em><sub><em>f</em><em>n</em></sub>)<sup><em>N</em></sup></span>.
            This relation (callend the geometric distribution, a special
            case of the negative-binomial distribution) is shown in
            fig. <strong>¿fig:negativebinom?</strong> for varying values
            of the false negative rate <span
            class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>f</em><em>n</em></sub></span>.
            This illustrates a fundamental link between our ability to
            reliably say an interaction doesn’t exist—<span
            class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>t</em><em>n</em></sub></span>—and
            the number of times we have observed a given species. In
            addition, note that there also is no non-zero <span
            class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>f</em><em>n</em></sub></span>
            for which we can ever <em>prove</em> that an interaction
            does not exist—no matter how many observations of
            non-interaction <span class="math inline"><em>N</em></span>
            we have, <span
            class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>t</em><em>n</em></sub> &lt; 1</span>.</p>
            <p>From fig. 1 (A) (and general intuition) it is clear that
            the more times we see two species <em>occurring</em>, but
            <em>not</em> interacting, the more likely the interaction is
            a true negative. But how does one decide what this threshold
            of number of observations should be when planning to sample
            a given system? If false-negative rates presented in fig. 1
            seem unrealistically high, consider that species are not
            observed independent of their relative abundance. In the
            next section we demonstrate that distribution of abundance
            in ecosystems can lead to realized values of <span
            class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>f</em><em>n</em></sub></span>
            similar to those in
            fig. <strong>¿fig:negativebinom?</strong> for species with
            low relative abundance, simply as a artifact of sampling
            effort.</p>

            id="false-negatives-as-a-product-of-relative-abundance">False-negatives
            as a product of relative abundance</h2>
            <p>Here we show the realized false-negative rate of species
            interactions changes drastically with sampling effort,
            largely due to the intrinsic variation of abundances within
            a community. We do this by simulating the process of
            observation of species interactions, applied both to 243
            empirical food webs from the Mangal database <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Banville2021ManJl">(Banville
            <em>et al.</em> 2021)</span> as well as random food-webs
            generated using the niche model <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Williams2000SimRul">(Williams &amp; Martinez
            2000)</span>. Our neutral model of observation assumes each
            observed species is drawn from the distribution of those
            species’ abundances at that place and time. Although there
            is no shortage of debate as to the processes the govern this
            distribution of abundances within a community, this
            abundance distribution can be reasonably-well described by a
            log-normal distribution <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Volkov2003NeuThe">(Volkov <em>et al.</em>
            2003)</span> (Note that in addition to the log-normal
            distribution, we also tested the case where the abundance
            distribution is derived from power-law scaling <span
            class="math inline"><em>Z</em><sup>(<em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>−1)</sup></span>
            where <span
            class="math inline"><em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span>
            is the trophic level of species <span
            class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> and <span

            data-cites="Savage2004EffBod">(Savage <em>et al.</em>
            2004)</span>, which yields the same qualitative behavior,
            <em>supplement figure 1</em>). The practical consequence of
            abundance distributions spanning many order of magnitude is
            seeing two “rare” species interacting requires two low
            probability events: observing two rare species <em>at the
            same time</em>.</p>
            <p>To simulate the process of observation, for an ecological
            network <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> with
            <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> species, we
            sample abundances for each species from a
            standard-log-normal distribution. For each true interaction
            in <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> (i.e. <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub> = 1</span>)
            we estimate the probability of observing both species <span
            class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>j</em></span> at given place and
            time by simulating <span
            class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> observations of
            individuals, where the species of the individual observed at
            the <span class="math inline">1, 2, …, <em>n</em></span>-th
            observation is drawn from the generated log-normal
            distribution of abundances. For each pair of species <span
            class="math inline">(<em>i</em>,<em>j</em>)</span>, if both
            <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>j</em></span> are observed within
            the <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span>
            observations, the interaction is tallied as a true positive
            if <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub> = 1</span>
            and a false positive otherwise. Similarly, if only one of
            <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> and <span
            class="math inline"><em>j</em></span> are observed—<em>but
            not both</em>—in these <span
            class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> observations, but
            <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub> = 1</span>,
            this is counted as a false-negative, and a true-negative
            otherwise.</p>

            obtain a “goal” number of observations (colors) of a

            has proven difficult to find and a meta-analysis of network
            data and sampling effort seems both pertinent and necessary,

            Further, from fig. <strong>¿fig:totalobs?</strong> it is
            evident that the number of species considered in a study is
            inseparable from the false-negative rate in that study, and
            this effect should be taken into account when designing
            samples of ecological networks in the future.</p>
            <p>We conclude this section by advocating for the use of
            neutral models similar to above to generate expectations
            about the number of false-negatives in a data set of a given
            size. This could prove fruitful both for designing surveys
            of interactions <span class="citation"

            <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> (as in
            fig. <strong>¿fig:totalobs?</strong> (c)), or to get a

            different resolutions, which is why we can’t simply apply
            this to the whole Mangal database—this highlights a general
            problem of resolving taxonomic indentifiers which use

            <p>We consider three properties: connectance,
            mean-degree-centrality, and spectral radius, indicative of
            local, meso, and global structure. Connectance is
            effectively a node-level property, a proxy for the degree
            distribution. Degree-centrality captures a different aspect
            of network structure than connectance, more indicative of
            meso-level properties that describe local ‘regions’ of nodes
            interact. Spectral radius (equivalent to the magnitude of
            the largest eigenvalue of <span
            class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>) is a measure of
            global structure, and demonstrates the most variability in
            response to false-negatives. For example, if a
            false-negative splits a metaweb into two components,
            spectral-radius becomes the largest eigenvalue of each of
            those two components. Also note that the form of this error
            function varies little as species richness changes
            (<em>supplemental figure 2</em>). Practically, fig. 3 shows
            us that different scales of measuring network structure vary
            in their response to false negatives—connectance responds
            roughly linearly to false negatives, whereas
            mean-degree-centrality decisively does not. This implies
            that false-negatives adversely could effect indirect
            interactions <span class="citation"

            <p>Here, we assess the effect of false negatives in data on
            our ability to make predictions about interactions. The
            prevalence of false-negatives in data is the catalyst for
            interaction prediction in the first place, and as a result
            methods have been proposed to counteract this bias <span
            class="citation"
            data-cites="Poisot2021ImpMam Stock2017LinFil">(Stock <em>et

            However, it is feasible this could induce too much noise for
            a interaction prediction model to detect the signal of
            interaction chance from to the latent properties of each
            species derived from the empirical network if the number of
            false-negatives in a dataset becomes too overwhelming.</p>
            <p>To test this, we use the same predictive model and
            dataset as in <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2021RoaPre">Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            (2021)</span> to predict a metaweb from various empirical
            slices of the species pool observed across space. This
            dataset from <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Hadfield2014TalTwo">Hadfield <em>et al.</em>
            (2014)</span> describes host-parasite interaction networks
            sampled across 51 sites. We partition the data into 80-20
            training-test split, and then seed the training data with
            false negatives varying rates, but crucially do nothing to
            the test data. We use the same model, a neural-network with
            3 feed-forward layers to predict outputs based on features
            extracted from co-occurence (see <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2021RoaPre">Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            (2021)</span> for more details). The single modification we
            make to the model is not enforcing a number of positives in
            the training data as this constraint is eventually
            impossible for increasing FNR. In fig. 4, we show
            receiving-operating-characteristic (ROC) and
            precision-recall (PR) curves for the model with varying
            levels of synthetic false-negatives added to the data.</p>

            <p>Interestingly, the performance of the model from <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Strydom2021RoaPre">Strydom
            <em>et al.</em> (2021)</span> changes little with many added
            false-negatives, which is good evidence in favor
            neural-networks as a class of model for interaction
            detection. Again, similar to our caveat in the previous
            section, this dazta is <em>already</em> likely to have many
            false-negatives, so the effects of adding more as we do in
            this illustration might be mitigated because there are
            already non-simulated false-negatives in the original data
            which impact the models performance, even in the <span
            class="math inline"><em>p</em><sub><em>f</em><em>n</em></sub> = 0</span>
            case.</p>
            <p>We conclude be proposing that simulating the effects of
            false negatives in this way can serve as an additional
            validation tool when aiming to detect structural properties
            of networks using generative null models <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Connor2017UsiNul">(Connor
            <em>et al.</em> 2017)</span>, or when evaluating the
            robustness of a predictive model.</p>
            <h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
            <p>Here, we have demonstrated that we expect false-negatives
            in species interaction datasets purely due to the
            distribution of abundances within a community. Positive
            associations between species occurrence <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Cazelles2016TheSpe">(Cazelles
            <em>et al.</em> 2016)</span> can increase the realized
            false-negative rate if the sampling effort is limited, and
            we have presented evidence of this non-random structure of
            co-occurrence in two sets of spatially-replicated ecological
            network samples. We have also shown that false-negatives can
            cause varying responses in our measurements of network
            properties and further could impact our ability to reliably
            predict interactions, which highlights the need for further
            research into methods for correcting this bias in existing
            data <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Stock2017LinFil">(Stock <em>et al.</em>
            2017)</span>. A brief caveat here is that we do not consider
            the rate of false-positives—in large part false-positives
            can be explained by misidentification of species, although
            this could be a relevant consideration in some cases.</p>
            <p>What does the future hold for this research? A better
            understanding of how false-negatives impact our analyses and
            prediction of ecological networks is a practical necessity.
            False-negatives could pose a problem for many forms of
            inference in network ecology. For example, if we aim to
            measure structural or dynamic stability of a network, or to
            infer indirect interactions <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Williams2002TwoDeg">(Williams <em>et al.</em>
            2002)</span>, these estimates could be prone to error if the
            observed network is not sampled “enough”. What exactly
            “enough” means is then specific to the application, and
            should be assessed via methods like those here when
            designing samples. Further, predictions about network
            rewiring <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Thompson2017DisGov">(Thompson &amp; Gonzalez
            2017)</span> due to a changing climate could be error-prone
            without accounting for interactions that have not been
            observed but that still may become climatically
            infeasible.</p>
            <p>This highlights the need for a quantitatively robust
            approach samples design: for interactions <span
            class="citation" data-cites="Jordano2016SamNet">(Jordano
            2016b)</span> and otherwise <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Carlson2020WhaWou">(Carlson <em>et al.</em>
            2020)</span>. The primary takeaway is that when planning the
            sampling effort across sites, it is necessary to take both
            the size of the species pool into account. Further,
            simulating the process of observation could be a powerful
            tool for planing study design which takes relative abundance
            into account, and provide a null baseline for detection of
            interaction strength. A model similar to that here can and
            should be used to provide a neutral expectation of
            true-negative probability given a number of observations of
            individuals at a given place and time.</p>
            <p>As we derive from
            fig. <strong>¿fig:negativebinom?</strong>, we can never
            guarantee there are no false-negatives in data. In recent
            years, there has been interest toward explicitly accounting

            toward a predictive approach toward interactions —rather
            than expect that our samples can fully capture all
            interactions, we know that some interactions between species
            will not be observed due to finite sampling capacity, and
            instead we must impute the true metaweb of interactions
            given a set of samples <span class="citation"
            data-cites="Strydom2021RoaPre">(Strydom <em>et al.</em>

            data-cites="Strydom2021RoaPre">(Strydom <em>et al.</em>
            2021)</span>, and building models that explicitly account
            for observation error is a necessary step forward for
